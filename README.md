  **2. Select your preferred VPS([Virtual Private Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server)) option. Here we choose the first option(10G VPS), which I highly recommend**   
  *(Cautious: Some of these options are charged by quater or month instead of year, so pay attention if you'd like to select one of the rest.)*
